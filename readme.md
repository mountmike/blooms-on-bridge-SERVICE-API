# Service API for Blooms on Bridge shop

This service API was bootstrapped off a [Crystallize][1] boilerplate to power the following features on my [NextJS ecommerce store][2] for Blooms on Bridge:

- User authentication with magic link
- Basket with cart validation
- Voucher codes
- Checkout with Stripe
- Crystallize webhooks (SendGrid email notifications)
